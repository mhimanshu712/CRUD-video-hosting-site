# myjunoon
A fully-functional video hosting platform, like youtube, for mobile devices<br>
I developed this for a startup.<br>
But they had change of plans and this was not used, so I made it public.<br>

#### It has a unique login system, feature to comment, profile page and stores user history.

A previous version has been hosted [here](http://myjunoon.herokuapp.com)
